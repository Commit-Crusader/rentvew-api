# RentView API

RentView API is a **Django REST Framework** backend for a property rental platform with integrated **virtual tour support**.  
It allows landlords to list properties, tenants to explore available rentals, and both to interact through a secure authentication system.  
This project is my **ALX Backend Web Development Capstone Project**.
